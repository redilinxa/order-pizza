## Project Requirements.
1. Task description
Let’s say you want to start a new pizza delivery business. Please create a web application for
ordering pizza for your clients, which contains a shopping cart. Take the pizza order and the
delivery address and contact details for the client. Login is not required but could be available
for checking the history of orders.
2. Requirements
• Your clients should be able to order pizzas from the menu
• The menu contains at least 8 pizzas
• You can decide what else you want in the menu
• Processing order/etc. with payment is NOT required. Concentrate on the interface to your
pizza customer up to the point the customer confirms his order.
• The pizza order process should cover ordering single or several pizzas with definition of the
quantity and calucation of a total price in Euros and US$ also adding delivery costs to the bill.
3. Technology (preferred as we use them in our company)
• Frontend – ReactJS
• Backend – Laravel
• Database – MySQL
• You get extra points for adding testing (for both frontend and backend);
• Design - you are free to use any framework or library whatever you want but keep in mind
we primarly judge functionality and workflow. Less is more.
4. Delivery format
• Please provide the repository links separately for frontend and backend with Demo
application URL (e.g. in Heroku).
• The solution has to be testable by a non-technical person
5. Resources
• Deployment of the application: Heroku
• Free mysql db host (https://remotemysql.com/);
• Use Git as code source management tool (following Git Flow will be assessed)
• Add Readme.md file
